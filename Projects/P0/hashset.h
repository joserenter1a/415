/*
 * create a HashSet
 *
 * freeValue is a function that returns any heap memory associated with
 * a set element to the heap; if specified as doNothing, nothing is done to
 * the elements before they are deleted
 *
 * cmp is used to determine equality between two objects, with
 * `cmp(first, second)' returning 0 if first==second, <>0 otherwise
 *
 * if capacity == 0L, the initial capacity is set to DEFAULT_SET_CAPACITY
 *
 * if loadFactor == 0.0, a default load factor (0.75) is used
 * if number of elements/number of buckets exceeds the load factor, the
 * table must be resized, doubling the number of buckets, up to a max
 * number of buckets (134,217,728)
 *
 * hashFunction is used to hash a value into the hash table that underlies
 * the set, with `hashFunction(value, N)' returning a number in [0,N)
 *
 * returns a pointer to the set, or NULL if there are malloc() errors
