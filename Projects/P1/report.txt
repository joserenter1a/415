CS415 Project 1

This is my own work, though I did receive help from Kart in office hours.
I discussed an approach to V1 with Joseph Macalino and Chance Curran,
and also pulled some of the code examples from SYSC on signal handlers, as well
as some code from a getopt tutorial from 212. 

I am pretty confident in v1 and v2, as they compile and run with no memory leaks.
But I struggled heavily in v3 and v4, and am less confident in those.
